			<h3>Webmail</h3>

			<p>Webmail lets you check your email from any web browser. Your webmail site is:</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 2em"><strong><a href="https://{{hostname}}/mail">https://{{hostname}}/mail</a></strong></p>
			<p>Your username is your whole email address.</p>


			<h3>Mobile/desktop apps</h3>

				<h4>Automatic configuration</h4>

					<p>iOS and OS X only: Open <a style="font-weight: bold" href="https://{{hostname}}/mailinabox.mobileconfig">this configuration link</a> on your iOS device or on your Mac desktop to easily set up mail (IMAP/SMTP), Contacts, and Calendar. Your username is your whole email address.</p>
	
				<h4>Manual configuration</h4>

					<p>Use the following settings when you set up your email on your phone, desktop, or other device:</p>

					<table class="table">
					<thead>
						<tr><th>Option</th> <th>Value</th></tr>
					</thead>
					<tr><th>Protocol/Method</th> <td>IMAP</td></tr>
					<tr><th>Mail server</th> <td>{{hostname}}</td>
					<tr><th>IMAP Port</th> <td>993</td></tr>
					<tr><th>IMAP Security</th> <td>SSL</td></tr>
					<tr><th>SMTP Port</th> <td>587</td></tr>
					<tr><th>SMTP Security</td> <td>STARTTLS <small>(&ldquo;always&rdquo; or &ldquo;required&rdquo;, if prompted)</small></td></tr>
					<tr><th>Username:</th> <td>Your whole email address.</td></tr>
					<tr><th>Password:</th> <td>Your mail password.</td></tr>
					</table>

					<p>In addition to setting up your email, you&rsquo;ll also need to set up <a href="#sync_guide" onclick="return show_panel(this);">contacts and calendar synchronization</a> separately.</p>

				<h4>Exchange/ActiveSync settings</h4>

					<p>On iOS devices, devices on this <a href="http://z-push.org/compatibility/">compatibility list</a>, or using Outlook 2007 or later on Windows 7 and later, you may set up your mail as an Exchange or ActiveSync server. However, we&rsquo;ve found this to be more buggy than using IMAP as described above. If you encounter any problems, please use the manual settings above.</p>

					<table class="table">
					<tr><th>Server</th> <td>{{hostname}}</td></tr>
					<tr><th>Options</th> <td>Secure Connection</td></tr>
					</table>

					<p>Your device should also provide a contacts list and calendar that syncs to this box when you use this method.</p>

			<h4>Greylisting</h4>
			<p>Your box using a technique called greylisting to cut down on spam. Greylisting works by delaying mail from people you haven&rsquo;t received mail from before for up to about 10 minutes. The vast majority of spam gets tricked by this. If you are waiting for an email from someone new, such as if you are registering on a new website and are waiting for an email confirmation, please give it up to 10-15 minutes to arrive.</p>

			<h4>+tag addresses</h4>
			<p>Every incoming email address also receives mail for <code>+tag</code> addresses. If your email address is <code>you@yourdomain.com</code>, you can also accept mail at <code>you+anythinghere@yourdomain.com</code>. Use this as a fast way to create aliases or to segment incoming mail for your own filtering rules.</p>

			<h4>Use only this box to send as you</h4>
			<p>Your box sets strict email sending policies for your domain names to make it harder for spam and other fraudulent mail to claim to be you. Only this machine is authorized to send email on behalf of your domain names. If you use any other service to send email as you, it will likely get spam filtered by recipients.</p>
