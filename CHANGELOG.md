CHANGELOG
=========

Development
-----------

Mail:

* If the box manages mail for a domain and a subdomain of that domain, outbound mail from the subdomain was not DKIM-signed and would therefore fail DMARC tests on the receiving end, possibly result in the mail heading into spam folders.
* Auto-configuration for Mozilla Thunderbird, Evolution, KMail, and Kontact is now available.
* Domains that only have a catch-all alias or domain alias no longer automatically create/require admin@ and postmaster@ addresses since they'll forward anyway.
* Roundcube is updated to version 1.1.0.
* Authentication-Results headers for DMARC are now added to incoming mail.

DNS:

* If a custom CNAME record is set on a 'www' subdomain, the default A/AAAA records were preventing the CNAME from working.
* If a custom DNS A record overrides one provided by the box, the a corresponding default IPv6 record by the box is removed since it will probably be incorrect.
* Internationalized domain names (IDNs) are now supported for DNS and web, but email is not yet tested.

Web:

* Static websites now deny access to certain dot (.) files and directories which typically have sensitive info: .ht*, .svn*, .git*, .hg*, .bzr*.
* The nginx server no longer reports its version and OS for better privacy.
* The HTTP->HTTPS redirect is now more efficient.
* When serving a 'www.' domain, reuse the SSL certificate for the parent domain if it covers the 'www' subdomain too
* If a custom DNS CNAME record is set on a domain, don't offer to put a website on that domain. (Same logic already applies to custom A/AAAA records.)

Control panel:

* Status checks now check that system services are actually running by pinging each port that should have something running on it.
* The status checks are now parallelized so they may be a little faster.
* The interface for setting website domain-specific directories is simplified.
* The mail guide now says that to use Outlook, Outlook 2007 or later on Windows 7 and later is required.

Setup:

* Install cron if it isn't already installed.
* Fix a units problem in the minimum memory check.
* If you override the STORAGE_ROOT, your setting will now persist if you re-run setup.
* Hangs due to apt wanting the user to resolve a conflict should now be fixed (apt will just clobber the problematic file now).

v0.06 (January 4, 2015)
-----------------------

Mail:

* Set better default system limits to accommodate boxes handling mail for 20+ users.

Contacts/calendar:

* Update to ownCloud to 7.0.4.
* Contacts syncing via ActiveSync wasn't working.

Control panel:

* New control panel for setting custom DNS settings (without having to use the API).
* Status checks showed a false positive for Spamhause blacklists and for secondary DNS in some cases.
* Status checks would fail to load if openssh-sever was not pre-installed, but openssh-server is not required.
* The local DNS cache is cleared before running the status checks using 'rncd' now rather than restarting 'bind9', which should be faster and wont interrupt other services.
* Multi-domain and wildcard certificate can now be installed through the control panel.
* The DNS API now allows the setting of SRV records.

Misc:

* IPv6 configuration error in postgrey, nginx.
* Missing dependency on sudo.

v0.05 (November 18, 2014)
-------------------------

Mail:

* The maximum size of outbound mail sent via webmail and Exchange/ActiveSync has been increased to 128 MB, the same as when using SMTP.
* Spam is no longer wrapped as an attachment inside a scary Spamassassin explanation. The original message is simply moved straight to the Spam folder unchanged.
* There is a new iOS/Mac OS X Configuration Profile link in the control panel which makes it easier to configure IMAP/SMTP/CalDAV/CardDAV on iOS devices and Macs.
* "Domain aliases" can now be configured in the control panel.
* Updated to [Roundcube 1.0.3](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog).
* IMAP/SMTP is now recommended even on iOS devices as Exchange/ActiveSync is terribly buggy.

Control panel:

* Installing an SSL certificate for the primary hostname would cause problems until a restart (services needed to be restarted).
* Installing SSL certificates would fail if /tmp was on a different filesystem.
* Better error messages when installing a SSL certificate fails.
* The local DNS cache is now cleared each time the system status checks are run.
* Documented how to use +tag addressing.
* Minor UI tweaks.

Other:

* Updated to [ownCloud 7.0.3](http://owncloud.org/changelog/).
* The ownCloud API is now exposed properly.
* DNSSEC now works on `.guide` domains now too (RSASHA256).

v0.04 (October 15, 2014)
------------------------

Breaking changes:

* On-disk backups are now retained for a minimum of 3 days instead of 14. Beyond that the user is responsible for making off-site copies.
* IMAP no longer supports the legacy SSLv3 protocol. SSLv3 is now known to be insecure. I don't believe any modern devices will be affected by this. HTTPS and SMTP submission already had SSLv3 disabled.

Control panel:

* The control panel has a new page for installing SSL certificates.
* The control panel has a new page for hosting static websites.
* The control panel now shows mailbox sizes on disk.
* It is now possible to create catch-all aliases from the control panel.
* Many usability improvements in the control panel.

DNS:

* Custom DNS A/AAAA records on subdomains were ignored.
* It is now possible to set up a secondary DNS server.
* DNS zones were updating even when nothing changed.
* Strict SPF and DMARC settings are now set on all subdomains not used for mail.

Security:

* DNSSEC is now supported for the .email TLD which required a different key algorithm.
* Nginx and Postfix now use 2048 bits of DH parameters instead of 1024.

Other:

* Spam filter learning by dragging mail in and out of the Spam folder should hopefully be working now.
* Some things were broken if the machine had an IPv6 address.
* Other things were broken if the machine was on a non-utf8 locale.
* No longer implementing webfinger.
* Removes apache before installing nginx, in case it has been installed by distro.

v0.03 (September 24, 2014)
--------------------------

* Update existing installs of Roundcube.
* Disabled catch-alls pending figuring out how to get users to take precedence.
* Z-Push was not working because in v0.02 we had accidentally moved to a different version.
* Z-Push is now locked to a specific commit so it doesn't change on us accidentally.
* The start script is now symlinked to /usr/local/bin/mailinabox.

v0.02 (September 21, 2014)
--------------------------

* Open the firewall to an alternative SSH port if set.
* Fixed missing dependencies.
* Set Z-Push to use sync command with ownCloud.
* Support more concurrent connections for z-push.
* In the status checks, handle wildcard certificates.
* Show the status of backups in the control panel.
* The control panel can now update a user's password.
* Some usability improvements in the control panel.
* Warn if a SSL cert is expiring in 30 days.
* Use SHA2 to generate CSRs.
* Better logic for determining when to take a full backup.
* Reduce DNS TTL, not that it seems to really matter.
* Add SSHFP DNS records.
* Add an API for setting custom DNS records 
* Update to ownCloud 7.0.2.
* Some things were broken if the machine had an IPv6 address.
* Use a dialogs library to ask users questions during setup.
* Other fixes.

v0.01 (August 19, 2014)
-----------------------

First release.
