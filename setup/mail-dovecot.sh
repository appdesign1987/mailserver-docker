# Dovecot (IMAP and LDA)
# ----------------------
#
# Dovecot is *both* the IMAP server (the protocol that email applications
# use to query a mailbox) as well as the local delivery agent (LDA),
# meaning it is responsible for writing emails to mailbox storage on disk.
# You could imagine why these things would be bundled together.
#
# As part of local mail delivery, Dovecot executes actions on incoming
# mail as defined in a "sieve" script.
#
# Dovecot's LDA role comes after spam filtering. Postfix hands mail off
# to Spamassassin which in turn hands it off to Dovecot. This all happens
# using the LMTP protocol.

# The `dovecot-imapd` and `dovecot-lmtpd` packages automatically enable IMAP and LMTP protocols.

# Set basic daemon options.

# The `default_process_limit` is 100, which constrains the total number
# of active IMAP connections (at, say, 5 open connections per user that
# would be 20 users). Set it to 250 times the number of cores this
# machine has, so on a two-core machine that's 500 processes/100 users).

	default_process_limit=$(echo "`nproc` * 250" | bc)

# The inotify `max_user_instances` default is 128, which constrains
# the total number of watched (IMAP IDLE push) folders by open connections.
# See http://www.dovecot.org/pipermail/dovecot/2013-March/088834.html.
# A reboot is required for this to take effect (which we don't do as
# as a part of setup). Test with `cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances`.

# ### IMAP

# Require that passwords are sent over SSL only, and allow the usual IMAP authentication mechanisms.
# The LOGIN mechanism is supposedly for Microsoft products like Outlook to do SMTP login (I guess
# since we're using Dovecot to handle SMTP authentication?).

	"auth_mechanisms=plain login"

# Enable SSL, specify the location of the SSL certificate and private key files.
# Disable obsolete SSL protocols and allow only good ciphers per http://baldric.net/2013/12/07/tls-ciphers-in-postfix-and-dovecot/.

	"ssl_cipher_list=TLSv1+HIGH !SSLv2 !RC4 !aNULL !eNULL !3DES @STRENGTH"

# Disable in-the-clear IMAP because there is no reason for a user to transmit
# login credentials outside of an encrypted connection. Although we haven't
# even installed the POP server, ensure it is disabled too.

# Make IMAP IDLE slightly more efficient. By default, Dovecot says "still here"
# every two minutes. With K-9 mail, the bandwidth and battery usage due to
# this are minimal. But for good measure, let's go to 4 minutes to halve the
# bandwidth and number of times the device's networking might be woken up.
# The risk is that if the connection is silent for too long it might be reset
# by a peer. See #129 and http://razor.occams.info/blog/2014/08/09/how-bad-is-imap-idle/.

# ### LDA (LMTP)

# Enable Dovecot's LDA service with the LMTP protocol. It will listen
# on port 10026, and Spamassassin will be configured to pass mail there.
#
# The disabled unix socket listener is normally how Postfix and Dovecot
# would communicate (see the Postfix setup script for the corresponding
# setting also commented out).
#
# Also increase the number of allowed IMAP connections per mailbox because
# we all have so many devices lately.

# Enable the Dovecot sieve plugin which let's users run scripts that process

#
# * `sieve_before`: The path to our global sieve which handles moving spam to the Spam folder.
#
# * `sieve`: The path to the user's main active script. ManageSieve will create a symbolic
# link here to the actual sieve script. It should not be in the mailbox directory
# (because then it might appear as a folder) and it should not be in the sieve_dir
# (because then I suppose it might appear to the user as one of their scripts).

# is also where the ManageSieve service stores the user's scripts.
