# Spam filtering with spamassassin via spampd
# -------------------------------------------
#
# spampd sits between postfix and dovecot. It takes mail from postfix
# over the LMTP protocol, runs spamassassin on it, and then passes the
# message over LMTP to dovecot for local delivery.
#
# In order to move spam automatically into the Spam folder we use the dovecot sieve
# plugin.

source /etc/mailinabox.conf # get global vars
source setup/functions.sh # load our functions

# Install packages and basic configuration
# ----------------------------------------

# Install packages.

# Allow spamassassin to download new rules.

# Pass messages on to docevot on port 10026.
# This is actually the default setting but we don't want to lose track of it.
# We've already configured Dovecot to listen on this port.
tools/editconf.py /etc/default/spampd DESTPORT=10026

# Spamassassin normally wraps spam as an attachment inside a fresh
# email with a report about the message. This also protects the user
# from accidentally openening a message with embedded malware.
#
# It's nice to see what rules caused the message to be marked as spam,
# but it's also annoying to get to the original message when it is an
# attachment, modern mail clients are safer now and don't load remote
# content or execute scripts, and it is probably confusing to most users.
#
# Tell Spamassassin not to modify the original message except for adding
# the X-Spam-Status mail header and related headers.

# Bayesean learning
# -----------------
#
# Spamassassin can learn from mail marked as spam or ham, but it needs to be
# configured. We'll store the learning data in our storage area.
#
# These files must be:
#
# * Writable by sa-learn-pipe script below, which run as the 'mail' user, for manual tagging of mail as spam/ham.
# * Readable by the spampd process ('spampd' user) during mail filtering.
# * Writable by the debian-spamd user, which runs /etc/cron.daily/spamassassin.
#
# We'll have these files owned by spampd and grant access to the other two processes.

# a shell script that invokes learning.
